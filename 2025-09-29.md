## Second Order
$$y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y = f(x)$$

## Second Order Homogenous
$$y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y = f(x) = 0$$

## Superposition 
If $y_1,y_2$ solve the homogenous equation, then the linear combination $y=c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ also solve the homogenous equation

Question: Are $y_1, y_2$ linearly independent? 
Answer: Wrongskian $W(y_1,y_2)$ is the determinant and if $W(y_1,y_2) = 0$ then the terms are linearly independent
