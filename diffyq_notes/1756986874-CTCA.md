# Partial Differential Equation

A PDE is one that contains partial derivatives with respect to more than one independent variable. 

Example:
$$\dfrac{\partial u} {\partial x} + \dfrac {\partial u}{\partial y} = 0$$

Observe in PDEs the equation contains **partial derivatives* with respect to **more than one independent variable**
