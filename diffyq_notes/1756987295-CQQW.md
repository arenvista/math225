# Linear Differential Equations

An *n*th-order [[1756984054-KDAV|Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)]] is [[1756987180-YVQQ|Linearity]] when it can be written in the form:

$$a_0(x)\dfrac{d^ny}{dx^n}+a_1(x)\dfrac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}}+...a_{n-1}(x)\dfrac{dy}{dx}+a_n(x)y=f(x)$$

$$\text{and } a_0(x) \neq 0$$

Observe:
* The **fucnctions** $a_0(x), ..., a_n(x)$ are called the **coefficents** of the differential equation
<!-- TODO: Elaborate on what the nonhomen term is -->
* $f(x)$ is called the **nonhomogenous term** 

<!-- TODO: What is the bearing of this statment? -->
When the coefficents are **constant functions** the DE is said to have ***constant coefficents***

The DE is said to be:
* **Homogenous** if $f(x)\equiv 0$
* **Non-homogenous** if $f(x)$ is *not* identically zero


Finally an ODE that cannot be written in the above general form is called a [[1756987812-EVWH|Non-linear Ordinary Differential Equation]]
