# Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)

ODEs are differnetial equations where the unknown function depends on a single real variable. 

Example:

$$\dfrac{dy}{dx} + y = y^2$$
$$\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2} = xy$$
$$x^2\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}+x\dfrac{dy}{dx}+(x^2-4)y=0$$
$$\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}-(1-y^2)\dfrac{dy}{dx}+y=0$$

In these DE:
* The unknown quantity $y=y{x}$ is called the *dependent variable*
* The real variable $x$ is called the *independent variable*
