# 3.2 Fundamental Solutions of Homogenous Equations

**Motivation**: To show that all solutions of the homogenous equation can be written as $y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$. *Where* $y_1,y_2$ are two linearly independent solutions

***Definition*** Linear Dependence v. Indepdence: Two functions, $f(x), g(x)$ are linearly independent on $I=[a,b]$ if $\exists k_1,k_2 \neq 0$ so that $k_1f(x) + k_2g(x) = 0, \forall x \in I$
