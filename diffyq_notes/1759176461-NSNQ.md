# 2nd Order Linear Equation

General Form:
$$a_o(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_2(x)y = g(x)$$

Presumes: g(x) is C[a,b] s.t. I = [a,b]


Rewrite: $a_o(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_2(x)y = g(x)$

$y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = f(x) = 0$

## Inital Value Problem 
IVP for 2nd-order equation: 

$$F(x,y,y',y'') = 0$$
$$y'' + py' + qy = f(x)$$ 

Inital Conditions: 
* $y(x_0) = y_0$
* $y'(x_0) = y_1$

Note: $y_0,y_1$ are given constants
