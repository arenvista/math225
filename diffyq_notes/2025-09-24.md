# Second  Order Linear Equation

General Form:
$$a_o(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_2(x)y = g(x)$$

Presumes: g(x) is C[a,b] s.t. I = [a,b]


Rewrite: $a_o(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_2(x)y = g(x)$

$y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = f(x) = 0$

## Inital Value Problem 
IVP for 2nd-order equation: 

$$F(x,y,y',y'') = 0$$
$$y'' + py' + qy = f(x)$$ 

Inital Conditions: 
* $y(x_0) = y_0$
* $y'(x_0) = y_1$

Note: $y_0,y_1$ are given constants

### Uniqueness and Existance
***Theorem***: 
* Let $p(x), g(x), f(x)$ be $C(a,b)$ s.t. $x_0 \in C(a,b)$
* Thus for any two numbers $y_0, y_1$, $\exists$ one and only one function statisfying the DE, $y''+py'+qy=f(x)$
* On the interval (a,b) that also satisfied the inital conditions $y(x_0) = y_0$, $y'(x_0) = y_1$

# Example: 

Determine the largest interval that contians a unique solution of: 

$$y'' + \dfrac{1}{x-1}y=e^{-x}$$

Given Inital Conditions: 
* $y(0) = 1$
* $y'(0) = 0$

Observe: 
* $p = 0$
* $q = \dfrac{1}{x-1}$
* $f(x) = e^{-x}$

Notice $p$ and $f(x)$ are C[-inf, inf]. However, $q$ is not continous at $1$

This gives us the folloiwing plausible intervals: 

* $(-\infty,1)$ **Note this is the only interval that contains our point of interest $x_0=0$**
* $(1,\infty)$

# 3.2 Fundamental Solutions of Homogenous Equations

**Motivation**: To show that all solutions of the homogenous equation can be written as $y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$. *Where* $y_1,y_2$ are two linearly independent solutions

***Definition*** Linear Dependence v. Indepdence: Two functions, $f(x), g(x)$ are linearly independent on $I=[a,b]$ if $\exists k_1,k_2 \neq 0$ so that $k_1f(x) + k_2g(x) = 0, \forall x \in I$

## Example of Dependence: 

Given: 

### 1. Example

* $f(x) = e^x$
* $g(x) = x+1$

Intuitively, these are linearly independent as we can not get an expoential function form one that is linear

### 2. Example

* $f(x) = sin(2x)$
* $g(x) = sin(x)cos(x)$

Observe: 
* $f(x) = 2 sin(x) cos(x)$ therefore is linearly dependent, as it is a multiple of $g(x)$

### 3. Example 

Clearly, 

* $f(x) = sin(x)$
* $g(x) = sin(x)$

Are linearly dependent

* $f(x) = e^x sin(x)$
* $g(x) = e^{-x} sin(x)$

These are linearly independent as there is no constant we can use to get f(x) into g(x) 

### 4. Example 

* $f(x) = 0$
* $g(x) =$ any function

Is always linearly dependent as we can take the g(x) and multiply the output by 0 to always get $f(x)$ which is equal to zero.

What if the dependence relation is not obvious?

We use the following 

# Wronskian

**Defn**: Given two differentiable functions $y_1, y_2$, the function

$W(y_1,y_2)$ = 
$\begin{bmatrix} y_1 && y_2 \\ y_1' && y_2' \end{bmatrix} = y_1*y_2' - y_1'*y_2$

Is called the *wrongskian* of $y_1$ and $y_2$.

Notice this really the determinant of A s.t. $det(A) = |A| = W(y_1,y_2)$

## Theorem: Wrongskian Test for Independence

Assume $p(x), q(x) \in C''[a,b]$ in $y'' + py' + qy = 0$ and $y_1,y_2$ are given functions. Then the following statements are equivalent.

1. $y_1, y_2$ are linearly independent solutions on (a,b)
2. $W(y_1,y_2) \neq 0, \forall x \in (a,b)$
3. $\exists x \in (a,b)$ s.t. $\exists W(y_1,y_2) \neq 0$ 

## Theorem: Independence Con't
If $y_1, y_2$ are Linearly Indepdendent of $y''+py'+qy=0$ Then any solution can be expressed uniquely as:
$$\exists c_1,c_2 \in \mathbb{R} \ni y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 $$

We call:
* {$y_1,y_2$} a fundamental set of solution 
* $\exists c_1,c_2 \in \mathbb{R} \ni y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ a general solution

### Example:
Show that $y_1 = e^x$ and $y_2 = e^{-2x}$ constitue a fundamental set of solutions for
$$\exists c_1,c_2 \in \mathbb{R} \ni y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$$
where: $p=1, q=-2$ and solve for the general solution

Show: 
1. Solves the DE equation
2. Show they are linearly indepdent by wrongskian
3. Show the general solution

#### Verify $y_1,y_2$ solve $y''+y'-2y=0$

For 
* Observe: $y_1$: $y_1=e^x, y_1'=e^x, y_1''=e^x$
* Subsituting: $y''+y'-2y=0$ turns into $e^x+e^x-e^x=0$ which equals 0 $\therefore$ solves the given DE

#### Compute the wrongskian
$W(y_1,y_2) = y_1*y_2' - y_1'*y_2 = e^x*-2e^{-2x} - e^x*e^{-2x} = =3e^xe^{-2x} \neq 0$
This imples $y_1,y_2$ are linearly independent on the interval

#### General Solution

Since $y_1,y_2$ are linearly independent any solve the given DE, therefore the general solution is: 

$$=y_1c_1 + c_2y_2 = c_1e^x + c_2e^{-2x}$$
