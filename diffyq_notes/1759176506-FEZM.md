# 2nd Order Linear (Uniqueness and Existence)
***Theorem***: 
* Let $p(x), g(x), f(x)$ be $C(a,b)$ s.t. $x_0 \in C(a,b)$
* Thus for any two numbers $y_0, y_1$, $\exists$ one and only one function statisfying the DE, $y''+py'+qy=f(x)$
* On the interval (a,b) that also satisfied the inital conditions $y(x_0) = y_0$, $y'(x_0) = y_1$

# Example: 

Determine the largest interval that contians a unique solution of: 

$$y'' + \dfrac{1}{x-1}y=e^{-x}$$

Given Inital Conditions: 
* $y(0) = 1$
* $y'(0) = 0$

Observe: 
* $p = 0$
* $q = \dfrac{1}{x-1}$
* $f(x) = e^{-x}$

Notice $p$ and $f(x)$ are C[-inf, inf]. However, $q$ is not continous at $1$

This gives us the folloiwing plausible intervals: 

* $(-\infty,1)$ **Note this is the only interval that contains our point of interest $x_0=0$**
* $(1,\infty)$
