# 2nd Order - Superposition
## Superposition 
If $y_1,y_2$ solve the homogenous equation, then the linear combination $y=c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ also solve the homogenous equation

Question: Are $y_1, y_2$ linearly independent? 
Answer: Wrongskian $W(y_1,y_2)$ is the determinant and if $W(y_1,y_2) \neq 0$ then the terms are linearly independent

If $\{y_1,y_2\}$ are linearly independent then they form the general solution to the homogenous equation
